# Cache
Caching is how DashLoader manages to get its incredible speed when loading Minecraft. A lot of Minecraft's assets are really hard to quickly create and DashLoader gets around this limitation by caching half of the game! 

You can also achieve great loading speeds by using DashLoader's api to cache your assets. The API is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible to your existing codebase.
